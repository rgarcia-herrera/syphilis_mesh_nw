# Syphilis Keyword Genesis and Development

So I read this fragment on Fleck's [Genesis and Development of a
Scientific Fact](http://www.evolocus.com/Textbooks/Fleck1979.pdf):

    It's as if we wanted to record in writing the natural course of an
    excited conversation among several persons all speaking
    simultaneously among themselves and each clamoring to make himself
    heard, yet which nevertheless permitted a consensus to
    crystallize. The continuity in time of the line of thought already
    mapped out must continually be interrupted to introduce other
    lines. The main line of development often must be held in abeyance
    to explicate connections. Moreover, a great deal has to be
    ommitted to preserve the idealized main line. Instead of a
    description of dynamic interactions, one is left with a more or
    less artificial scheme.

I immediately thought of this timeline:

So I did a [search for syphilis in
PubMed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=syphilis), a large
database of citations for biomedical literature.

There's 33,659 citations, from 1817 to 2016.

I then grabbed [MeSH
terms](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/meshhome.html) from each citation,
when they were available, or took keywords from the title or abstract
using [Pattern](http://www.clips.ua.ac.be/pages/pattern-vector), a
natural language processor.

I've grouped these keywords per year, next I'll try to plot them!
